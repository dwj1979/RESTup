The principle of the interface:
 - select the service folder;
 - copy the source files to the "%inFilesFolder%" subfolder;
 - return the result from the subfolder "%outFilesFolder%".
   For some WebDAV clients it is necessary to update its contents manually.
   If an error occurred, the file "Oops! Internal Server Error" is created.
 
The total size of your files is limited to %sessionQuota% MiB, 
and the storage time is %sessionTimeout% min.

In the list below the service folders are marked with a "+" sign.
For them, valid extensions (types) of source files are specified,
(*) means "any file", including the creation of subdirectories.
Folders marked with "-" are used for grouping purposes and are read-only.
