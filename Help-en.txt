The principle of the interface:
 - select the service folder;
 - copy the source files to the "%inFilesFolder%" subfolder;
 - return the result from the subfolder "%outFilesFolder%",
   in some cases it is necessary to update its contents.

The total size of your files is limited to %sessionQuota% MiB, 
and the storage time is %sessionTimeout% min.

In the list below the service folders are marked with a "+" sign.
For them, valid extensions (types) of source files are specified,
(*) means "any file", including the creation of subdirectories.
Folders marked with "-" are used for grouping purposes and are read-only.
